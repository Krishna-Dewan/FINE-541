#Portfolio Optimization: Strategic Benchmark-Centric Allocation

A quantitative framework for optimizing portfolio allocation against a user-defined benchmark. This tool is designed for investors transitioning from a concentrated position to a diversified portfolio while aiming to maintain or exceed benchmark performance.

## Overview

This software implements a disciplined portfolio construction methodology that integrates investor forecasts with financial theory. It determines the optimal allocation to maximize the risk-adjusted return of a new portfolio relative to a specified benchmark (typically the investor's original concentrated asset).

## Core Objective

To answer the strategic question: 

**"Given a portfolio concentrated in a single asset (XCV) and forward-looking price targets for alternative assets, what is the optimal set of trades to execute so the new diversified portfolio is expected to outperform the original concentrated portfolio on a risk-adjusted basis?"**

## Methodology

### Data Processing
- **Input:** Historical price data for all assets and relevant foreign exchange rates
- **Processing:** Handles multiple CSV files, converts USD-denominated prices to CAD, and aligns all historical time series by date
- **Output:** Clean, consolidated matrix of daily CAD-denominated prices

### Forecasting Approach
- **Benchmark Asset (XCV):** Expected return derived from Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- **Active Assets (LAS, AA, GLD):** Expected return calculated from user-provided price targets

### Risk Modeling
- **Systematic Risk:** Portion of asset risk attributable to benchmark movements (quantified by beta)
- **Idiosyncratic Risk:** Asset-specific risk uncorrelated with the benchmark (reducible through diversification)
- The covariance matrix is constructed explicitly from these components

### Optimization
- Maximizes Sharpe Ratio (return per unit of risk)
- Incorporates practical constraints (minimum/maximum allocation limits)
- Solves for optimal portfolio weights using mathematical optimization algorithms

## Performance Metrics

The framework evaluates proposed portfolios using institutional standard metrics:

- **Expected Return & Volatility:** Absolute forecasted annual return and risk
- **Jensen's Alpha:** Excess return over benchmark, adjusted for beta exposure
- **Tracking Error:** Standard deviation of portfolio returns relative to benchmark (measures active risk)
- **Information Ratio:** Alpha divided by Tracking Error (excess return per unit of active risk)

## Key Outputs

1. **Optimal Allocation Weights:** Recommended percentage allocation for each asset
2. **Explicit Trade Instructions:** Dollar amounts to buy/sell for portfolio transition
3. **Comparative Performance Analysis:** Projection of optimal portfolio vs. benchmark performance

## Interpretation Guide

### Information Ratio (IR) Assessment:
- **IR > 0.5:** Strong strategy with significant excess return for active risk taken
- **IR > 0:** Positive expected excess return (evaluate magnitude relative to goals)
- **IR â‰¤ 0:** Strategy not expected to outperform benchmark after risk adjustment

### Additional Signals:
- **Positive Jensen's Alpha:** Outperformance attributable to asset selection skill rather than additional benchmark risk
- **Tracking Error:** Level of active risk relative to benchmark

## Intended Use Case

This framework is designed for investors who:
- Seek to reduce single-asset concentration risk systematically
- Have developed firm-specific views on alternative investments
- Require a structured process to translate qualitative views into quantitative allocations
- Demand pre-trade analysis of expected risk/return profile versus status quo

## Project Structure



## Implementation

The tool is implemented in R using:
- `CVXR` for convex optimization
- `dplyr`, `purrr` for data manipulation
- `quantmod`, `PerformanceAnalytics` for financial analysis
